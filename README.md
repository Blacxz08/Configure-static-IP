<h3> Description</h3>
Linux Network Configuration and SSH project has provided a solid foundation for understanding and implementing essential cybersecurity skills. By completing this project, I have demonstrated my ability to configure a virtual machine with a static IP address, generate SSH keys, securely connect two devices, and also my basic understanding of Linux syntax. I have also showcased my understanding of SSH best practices, such as key pair management, disabling root login, and limiting user access.
